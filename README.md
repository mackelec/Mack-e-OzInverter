This controller is base on the ideas od the OzInverter often featured on the [BackShed Forum](https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/forum_topics.asp?FID=4) and the Nano code is modified from Poida's Nano inverter Code.

This controller plugs directly into my Full-Bridge-Driver board that I use in my  WarpVerter project
